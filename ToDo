            - inventoryGui render disable fancy rendering
            - magically updates when player touches down? how is that possible? -solved with deployed?
            - figure out, personally, the gl code, so I understand it for the future
        add red/white dye to recipes?

    LATER:

        DEFINITE:
            Make model for bars hanging down.
        MAYBE:

            Blow up the item perspective in fpp of wings to be huge?

    EVENTUAL FEATURES:
