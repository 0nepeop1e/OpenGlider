To Do:

    - Refine CF page

    BUGS:

    NOW:


    LATER:

        DEFINITE:
            JEI for repair (and for info b/c why not)
            Durability depends on blocks traveled, not time in the air (intelligent durability usage)
            Sturdy glider crafted w/ elytra, invulnerable to wind
                New model
            Release for 1.11
        MAYBE:
            Longer hold shift the faster you go?
            Collision redirect (so hit a tree in midair and you turn)?
            Air currents? Forward/backward/up/down momentum?
                3D wind
            Make model for bars hanging down.
            Add tiers of gliders?
            Blow up the item perspective in fpp of wings to be huge?
            add red/white dye to recipes?
            Enchants only specific ones possible
            Investigate shift and "[player] moved wrongly"
            Non-instant deployment time?
            Multiple gliders oddness (transferring from one to another directly, need UUIDs for deployed)
            "broken" texture doesn't always update in-hand

    EVENTUAL FEATURES:
        Add enable transparent glider in FPP by wrapping entire render model code in enable blend GL call.
            See how easy it will be to do, if it is trivial then sure, why not

    BALANCE:
