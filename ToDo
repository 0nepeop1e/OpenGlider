To Do:

    - Refine CF page

    BUGS:
        VISUAL:
            Lighting bug is actually annoying, fix that. Also may conflict w/ Optifine and odd tree rending when flying over (conflicts with shaders for sure in fpp).
            Multiple gliders oddness (gliding w/ one means all change to bar texture)
            "broken" texture doesn't always update in-hand

    NOW:


    LATER:

        DEFINITE:
            JEI for repair (and for info b/c why not)
            Print out message of elytra equipped if can't enable glider
            Disable offhand rendering if flying
            Durability depends on blocks traveled, not time in the air (intelligent durability usage)
            Sturdy glider crafted w/ elytra, invulnerable to wind
                New model
            Release for 1.11
        MAYBE:
            Longer hold shift the faster you go?
            Collision redirect (so hit a tree in midair and you turn)
            Air currents? Forward/backward/up/down momentum?
                3D wind
            Make model for bars hanging down.
            Add tiers of gliders?
            Blow up the item perspective in fpp of wings to be huge?
            add red/white dye to recipes?
            Enchants only specific ones possible
            Investigate shift and "[player] moved wrongly"
            Enforce lighting correctly in dark settings (e.g. raining):
                    /* from jamieswhiteshirt
                     you'll have to re-enable culling and draw the quad twice, one for the bottom face and one for the top face
                     normals are transformed like your vertices
                     the thing is that you need to render both sides of the hangglider separately when you use normals
                     the bottom side has the normal [0, -1, 0] and the top side has the normal [0, 1, 0]
                     the only reason it's rendering both sides now is because you disabled culling
