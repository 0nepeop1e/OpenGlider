    Refine CF page
        Add info about multiple tiers
        Add info about upgrade(s)


    BUGS:
        check durability of right item being taken away
        test on servers
        check rocket boosting works

    NOW:


    LATER:

        DEFINITE:
            Fix re-equip nonsense
            JEI for repair (and for info b/c why not)
            Durability depends on blocks traveled, not time in the air (intelligent durability usage)
            Lighten models in fpp
            Tone down y-level param a little //Test
            Elytra wind sound
            Release for 1.11
            Check update forge/JEI
            Add in functionality for compass upgrade
        EVENTUAL:
            Update IssueTemplate/Contributing
            Test gradle forge version updates
            Gradle api built
            Longer hold shift the faster you go?
            Make jsons extend from base_glider.json and base_glider_broken, etc.
            Secret naussica model for glider?
            Enforce config sync from server to client for non-visual options
        MAYBE:
            Add API-way to change rendering (so other mods can alter it)
                startGliderRenderEvent?
            Damage based on fall distance already (so hurt yourself if you are falling super far and hang glide to stop), and make it smoother motion?
            Collision redirect (so hit a tree in midair and you turn)?
            Air currents? Forward/backward/up/down momentum?
                3D wind
                Updrafts with certain blocks (i.e. lava)
            Make model for bars hanging down.
            Upgrades for more durability/less wind/etc?
            Blow up the item perspective in fpp of wings to be huge?
            Add red/white dye to recipes?
            Enchants only specific ones possible
            Investigate shift and "[player] moved wrongly"
            Non-instant deployment time?
            "broken" texture doesn't always update in-hand

    EVENTUAL FEATURES:
        Add enable transparent glider in FPP by wrapping entire render model code in enable blend GL call.
            See how easy it will be to do, if it is trivial then sure, why not

        Add in possibility to not enforce holding glider while flying.

    BALANCE:
