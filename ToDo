To Do:

    //ToDo discord textures from InsomniaKitten
    //tterrag source for rendering others updates: https://github.com/tterrag1098/PotionAPI/blob/master/src/main/java/tterrag/potionapi/api/effect/EffectUtil.java

    NOW:
        Fix player rendering
            - jumpy for others
            - fix fpp
            - inventoryGui render disable fancy rendering
            - magically updates when player touches down? how is that possible?
            - figure out, personally, the gl code, so I understand it for the future
        Disable when elytra
        add red/white dye to recipes?

    LATER:

        DEFINITE:
            Re-add deployed ability.
            Make model for bars hanging down.
        MAYBE:
            Add tiers of gliders?
            Blow up the item perspective in fpp to be a huge wing?

    EVENTUAL FEATURES:

    BALANCE:
        config (easy mode vs all these tweaks?)
        Durability
        Inaccuracy
