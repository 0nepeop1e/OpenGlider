To Do:

    - add icon for fpp
    - new icon for in-hand when deployed vs not deployed

    NOW:
        Fix player rendering
            - jumpy for others
            - inventoryGui render disable fancy rendering when going horizontal (how to do that?)
            - figure out, personally, the gl code, so I understand it for the future

    LATER:

        DEFINITE:
            Make model for bars hanging down.
        MAYBE:
            Add tiers of gliders?
            Blow up the item perspective in fpp of wings to be huge?
            add red/white dye to recipes?

    EVENTUAL FEATURES:

    BALANCE:
        config (easy mode vs all these tweaks?)
        Durability
        Inaccuracy
