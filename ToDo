    Swiss cheese theory - layers for broken gliders

    Make separate/new model for glider
        Make appear in FPP, finish side struts in 3PP as well

        can change scale to 0,0,0 to disappear

    BUGS:

    NOW:


    LATER:

        DEFINITE:
            Fix re-equip nonsense
                broken basic glider not showing up
            JEI for repair (and for info b/c why not)
            Add in functionality for compass upgrade
            Lighten models in fpp
            Tone down y-level param a little //Test
            Elytra wind sound
            Check update forge/JEI
            Make model for bars hanging down.

        EVENTUAL:
            Durability depends on blocks traveled, not time in the air (intelligent durability usage)
            Release for 1.11
            Update IssueTemplate/Contributing
            Test gradle forge version updates
            Gradle api built
            Longer hold shift the faster you go?
            Make jsons extend from base_glider.json and base_glider_broken, etc.
            Secret naussica model for glider?
            Enforce config sync from server to client for non-visual options
            Work on forge version increment via gradle replace task, make sure correct
        MAYBE:
            Add API-way to change rendering (so other mods can alter it)
                startGliderRenderEvent?
            Damage based on fall distance already (so hurt yourself if you are falling super far and hang glide to stop), and make it smoother motion?
            Collision redirect (so hit a tree in midair and you turn)?
            Air currents? Forward/backward/up/down momentum?
                3D wind
                Updrafts with certain blocks (i.e. lava)
            Upgrades for more durability/less wind/etc?
            Blow up the item perspective in fpp of wings to be huge?
            Add red/white dye to recipes?
            Enchants only specific ones possible
            Investigate shift and "[player] moved wrongly"
            Non-instant deployment time?
            "broken" texture doesn't always update in-hand

    EVENTUAL FEATURES:
        Add enable transparent glider in FPP by wrapping entire render model code in enable blend GL call.
            See how easy it will be to do, if it is trivial then sure, why not

        Add in possibility to not enforce holding glider while flying.

    BALANCE:
